# 🌟 Talent Protocol Integration

SusuFlow-AI integrates with **Talent Protocol** to showcase the reputation of our users.

## How it Works
We fetch the **Builder Score** of connected users and display it in the Navbar. This helps build trust within our savings circles.

## Setup
To enable this feature, you need a Talent Protocol API Key.

1.  Get an API Key from [Talent Protocol](https://talentprotocol.com).
2.  Add it to your `.env.local` file:
    ```bash
    TALENT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## For Builders
By integrating Talent Protocol, SusuFlow-AI contributes to the ecosystem's reputation layer. As the builder of this app, you can also earn reputation points!
